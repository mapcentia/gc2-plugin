# Skills Index

This folder contains the GC2 (Geo Compute Cloud) skills. Start with `gc2-rules`, which holds the global hard rules and routes to the task-specific skills below.

## Quick Routing

## Core Rule

Global hard rules stay in `gc2-rules/SKILL.md`; `AGENTS.md` at the repo root only points there.
Task-specific workflows and references stay in `skills/*/SKILL.md`.
